  <b>Ipsum Asinorum</b> is my way to expose my ideas with those cursious enough to explore.
  More than this, is a peace of me: my thoughts, projects, books, ideas, ...<br>
  I Invite you to meet me and my crazy mind, wandering through some chaos and creativity.
</p>
<br>
<p>Here we'll be daydreaming, learning and being craziest as possible.</p>
<br>
<p>
  I began this project because I wanted to do something every day.<br>
  As you can see, I didn't stop as a simple blog.<br>
  I like challenges, innovations, smell opportunities and love to work and learn. And above all: I'm proudly crazy.<br>
  Crazy in my thoughts, ideas and projects. My books, mainly.<br>
  If every thing can be interesting, why isn't it.

<h2>My Trajectory:</h2>
<p>I'm born in Brasil, Rio de Janeiro - RJ, but raised in Alegrete - RS.<br>
  My first job was as baker's assistant, then I start teching guitar in a school, played guitar in a band, than I move to Rio de Janeiro again where I worked as kichen assistant in a japanese fastfood, as stockist, checkout operator, transport assistant and unloading trucks at a pharmaceutical company. After, I was unemployed for a while until I move to Cascavel - PR, where I worked as parking assistant and stocker at a market, so I worked at a internet company as field assistant, half official and fiber optic technician where I stay until I hurt my back, and with the university I've already began, I work for my first experience as a developer home office, workin at a company in Santa Catarina - RS from my house in Cascavel - PR. Unfortunately, I was fired in a mass layoff and had to go back to work in the market as a stocker, where I stayed until I got my current job as a support analyst. After a few months, I started working at night as a poker delaer too.
